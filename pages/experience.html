        <h2>Data Science Co-op – LLM, LangChain, Embedding, Streamlit, Python, Alteryx, Power BI</h2>
        <p><strong>Baker Tilly Canada</strong> May 2025 – Aug 2025 | Toronto, Canada</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed and deployed a SOC 2 audit automation system with interactive ML-driven control testing dashboard and LLM chatbot for policy search and evidence interpretation, cutting manual workload by 90%.</li>
          <li>Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline (LangChain, Gemini, Python) that uses LLM-driven judgment to assess evidence across 80+ controls, increasing audit flagging accuracy by 85% and reducing review time by 70%.</li>
          <li>Implemented RAG with vector search and embeddings (LangChain, FAISS) to power dynamic SOC testing queries and policy lookups, enhancing interpretability and decision accuracy by 85%.</li>
          <li>Engineered recursive OCR + anonymization system (Tesseract, SpaCy) for text extraction and entity masking and integrated Gemini to automate compliance decisions, cutting document processing time by 75%.</li>
          <li>Designed Alteryx workflows for automated data cleaning, merging, and transformation and performed interactive Power BI dashboards, streamlining analysis speed for audit GL review and tax compliance reporting by 80%.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research Assistant – OpenCV, Arduino, 3D-Modelling & Printing</h2>
        <p><strong>Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences</strong> Apr 2021 – Nov 2021 | Shanghai, China</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed a computer vision pipeline using OpenCV and MediaPipe to recognize real-time piano hand gestures via 21-point hand landmark extraction, improving gesture detection accuracy by 65%.</li>
          <li>Performed statistical post-processing and gesture classification using Python (NumPy, scikit-learn) and conducted calibration experiments to reduce outlier noise and enhance tracking robustness.</li>
          <li>Enhanced player gesture stability by 40% through 10+ iterative 3D-printed designs and integrated Arduino-based feedback mechanisms with ultrasonic sensing and buzzer alerts for real-time posture correction.</li>
          <li>Awarded 3rd Prize out of 15,000+ students in both the Shanghai Youth Science and Technology Innovation Competition and the Shanghai Future Science Star.</li>
