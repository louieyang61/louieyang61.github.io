            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This is Louie Yang.</p>
            <p>I’m a aspiring junior at the University of Toronto, specializing in Statistics – Statistical Machine Learning and Data Science Stream, and majoring in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>As the Research Assistant at Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, I’ve had ample experience in Machine Vision, 3D modeling and image recognition. Proficient in diverse data analysis tools such as R, PowerBI, Matlab, MySQL, RStudio, I’ve led fruitful projects like Statistical Analysis on Research Project Investments (82% accuracy) and Piano Gesture Corrector based on 3D printing and Arduino.</p>
            <p>As for my extracurricular activities, I love badminton, debate and trumpet (Seat of honour and trumpet soloist at uoft orchestra).</p>
